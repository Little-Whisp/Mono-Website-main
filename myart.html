                    Being able to capture a concept I came up with in animation is true beauty to me. Growing up I
                    always used
                    lose myself in while watching animation movies from Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks and so many more.
                    These are the movies that
                    taught me to dream big and showed me that if you work really hard and have the heart for it, you
                    will create wonderful things.
                    On this page you'll see a couple animations I worked on!

                <p>
                    I did this animation of a plant for a school assignment! It was for an elective called "The art of
                    storytelling". For our first assignment,
                    we had to tell a story about a plant that had a problem. I thought this would be the perfect moment
                    to challenge myself to animate something and get super creative with how i was gonna do this.
                    I wanted to finish this animation in one day and and make something that was short but sweet. I came
                    up with this idea of a plant
                    that was alone in the rain and simpely wanted some company. All the sudden this other charater
                    (bunny) Would walk by looking for shelter,
                    and finding that shelter with this plant.
                </p>

                <p>To make this animation in 1 day I picked a very simple art style. Something i knew I could draw fast
                    and consistent. I already worked on a simular animatic for another school assignment some time
                    before making
                    this one (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq8XjRjapmY">Click to see that animation</a>
                    ). So i used that storyboard instead of having to make one from scratch. Doing this allowed me to
                    immediately
                    start animating! It took me 16 hours total to make this animation, and yes, I did it all in 1 day :)
                </p>

                <p>
                    This animation took me 1 day aswell. I want to make a trailer like animation. I did this to practice
                    my understanding in cinematography
                    Most of the fragments you see
                    are high quality drawings I did. I want to animate only one thing in this animation, which was the
                    main character.
                    I had never animated humans, so I wanted to make the animation as smooth as I could. The anime
                    "Violet Evergarden"
                    was my big inspiration for this animations. You can also see a bit of the style of that anime coming
                    back in the design of the character.
                    And I of course used a track of the soundtrack called "A Dolls Beginning". This is very important,
                    because I also wanted to visualize
                    the images/animation I imagined while listening to this track. The character you see in this
                    animation
                    are members from one of my favourite bands (Palaye Royale). I thought it would make the proces more
                    fun,
                    if I make art about something I'm interested in!

                <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi8YGgiakM">Click to view: Animation The Bee</a>


                <p>
                    This was my first animation ever made. I called it 'The Bee'. I wanted to see what I could make
                    without
                    zero experience in animated. With this animation I wanted to practice the principles of animation.
                    With
                    the walking
                    cycle I wanted to practice timing and spacing, to make it so that the walking looked smooth. I
                    always
                    like it when characters
                    have over exaggerated expressions in cartoons. I want to also try this when the character stops
                    and sees the bee it's neck grows longer, because it first passes the bee by like it's nothing
                    intresting
                    than realizes he just saw this cute bee sleeping in a flower. I tried to use squash and stretch to
                    achieve that. I wanted the character's movements to synchronize with the music, reminiscent of the
                    style seen in old Disney movies.
                    Interestingly, I achieved this purely by feeling.

                    This is another fan animation I created featuring the band Palaye Royale. I wanted to keep it simple
                    and
                    suitable for looping. I animated one of the band members sleeping, with a dreamlike subject passing
                    by them.

                    I created this animation to practice animating flight sequences. It was a great opportunity for me
                    to
                    improve my skills in depicting flying movements.

                    Concept art serves as the foundation for storytelling, enabling me to
                    visualize and design characters, environments, and narratives from scratch and make them come alive.
                    I love the process of
                    ideation and iteration, where every stroke of the pen or brush holds the potential to shape an
                    entire world. Concept art is not just about creating pretty pictures; it's about capturing the
                    essence of a story, conveying emotions, and sparking imagination. For me, there's nothing more
                    fulfilling than seeing an idea evolve from a simple sketch to a fully realized work of art.

                <br>

                <p> The concept of Elias von Helach, a boss design I did for an unfinished game, emerged through a
                    series of
                    iterations and diverse inspirations. Drawing from the dark art style of Bloodborne, I
                    aimed to capture the eerie and foreboding atmosphere synonymous with the game. Additionally, the
                    tragic transformation of Nina Tucker in Fullmetal Alchemist, where her innocence is twisted into a
                    monstrous form by her father, served as inspiration for Elias's character. I also found
                    inspiration in the character Jacob Marley from the movie Christmas Carol 2009, particularly the
                    chilling sound of his chains. The haunting resonance of Marley's chains in the film used is
                    terrifying to
                    me, and I wanted a similar sense of dread through Elias's design, incorporating symbolic
                    elements of chains to enhance his ominous presence. Through the fusion of these influences, Elias
                    von Helach emerged as a character that embodies both the haunting ambience from Bloodborne, the
                    tragic
                    transformation depicted in Fullmetal Alchemist, and the haunting presence of Jacob Marley." </p>

                <p>When tasked with creating an scene for a VR game for the company I work at, Sync Vr, I came up with
                    creating an Underwater Cave scene. I wanted to
                    design an environment that would provide a relaxing and immersive experience for the player.
                    Understanding the importance of spatial design in VR, I focused on creating an environment with nice
                    spacing to enhance the sense of depth and immersion. Closed-off spaces in VR can often feel
                    claustrophobic, so I aimed to counteract this by designing the cave with multiple openings, allowing
                    the player to feel a sense of openness and freedom within the environment. Additionally, I was
                    conscious of the common association of caves with darkness and uncertainty, which can evoke feelings
                    of fear or unease. To avoid this, I ensured that the cave was well-lit and included ample natural
                    lighting sources to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. By incorporating these elements, I aimed
                    to create a tranquil and welcoming underwater cave scene that would provide players with a serene
                    and enjoyable experience.</p>

                <p>
                    My fascination with 3D art blossomed through the works of Pixar. Seeing how they bring characters
                    and
                    worlds to life with stunning detail and emotion made me want to learn how to do this aswell. Pixar's
                    ability to
                    create
                    immersive storytelling experiences through innovative animation techniques continues to inspire and
                    drive my passion in art of any media.
