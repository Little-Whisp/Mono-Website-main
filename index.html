        <p>
          My name is Silviani Martis and I am a fourth year CMGT student at Hogeschool Rotterdam! I chose this study
          because I love technology and I love creating my own stuff.
          Such as games, applications, websites, robots, you name it! I love to bring concepts I come up with to life
          and use my creativity to make that happen in a way that makes people happy :)

          Currently I work at a store called Spellenwinkel Where we sell boardgames and TCG games like Magic the Gathering and Pokemon.
          I love helping customers and giving them advice on what game they should buy. Combining my passion for games with my work is one 
          of the coolest things ever. (2024 - Currently)

          I worked at a company called Sync VR. Sync VR Medical is a company that focuses on using Virtual reality to help
          out in the medical world. A group of goofballs that want to make things
          big and help people. I used to film with a 360 camera for projects and edit video's for virtual reality. I also make
          something we call, relax and distract exercises.
          Where I worked on this game like environment that helps the player relax and get distracted while undergoing a
          medical procedure. (2022 - 2024)

          For my school I worked at project that's called VR lab, where I got the opportunity to introduce students to
          new technology such as cool VR headsets like the Varjo, 3D scanner applications,
          the Hololense and much more. VR lab wants students to be able to use the tech they offer quick and easy.
          That's why they give workshops for programs like Unity where you get to make your own little game, blender for
          3D modeling and I also gave my own workshop about
          360 editing in Premiere Pro! That's why it used to be my job to play around with new technology and look for
          creative methods on how VR lab can share that technology with students in an accessible way.

          Game school project (year 1) - Synthese

        <p>
          For this school project, we got to make an education game for kids. We called it Syntheses and mostly wanted
          to bring the theme of the game to life. We wanted the style to be
          Memorable and nice to look at. I mostly worked on the art of Syntheses and the code of the shoot function and
          the movement of our character Didi.

          Machine learning project (year 2) - DrugType Predictor
        </h1>

        <p>
          For this project, we had to make a web application that used machine learning to predict something. My
          application predicts the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for a patient!
          I took the opportunity to go all out with the style of the website because the visuals where very important
          during this project, because next to making a functioning website we as CMGT students
          find it very important to make our projects visually pleasing.

          Currently I'm working a project for school where I'm going to create a short virtual experience where you play 
          as a bartender and engage in interactions based on how you judge the appearance of avatars. Your task is to serve 
          drinks to avatars based on specific prompts, like "Serve a drink to someone who looks friendly", While you collect
          points for doing your tasks correctly. At the end of the experience, you’ll get insight into your decisions and how 
          your interactions compare to those of other players.That’s how I want to gain insight into biases and perception in virtual environments.

        <p>I've been making this game in Unity using C#, which has been so much fun. I've worked in Unity before, 
          but I never coded my own features until now, and I've really been enjoying it. I was really nervous when I started 
          but after trying out some things I got a lot more comfortable in the work flow of coding in Unity, which is something I'm 
          actually a little proud of. I still need a little help from Copilot, but I've already learned so much while working on 
          this game over the past few weeks! I showed myself I can create things I never thought I would ever be able to, which is the coolest thing ever to me! I can't wait to see what the final result will look like. I'm still working on this project, 
          but below you can see what I have so far.

        <p>This is the first prototype where I tried to get an interaction of picking up a glass and then getting visual feedback to work!<p>

             <p>
This is a bit of progress from a couple of weeks after the first prototype. I added features like a prompt generator, bar trigger (to trigger the prompt generator), a timer, and a score counter.
During this time, I was really struggling to get things working in my project. Getting comfortable with Unity took a little while, so this prototype looks far from perfect—but it still did the job.
I was able to test the features I needed using the XR Simulator in Unity, which lets you test your game without a VR headset (which I didn’t always have access to).
        <p>

           <div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LR-zs-XhYDc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
             <p>
              
The third prototype and one I'm actually really proud of!! I did the video in dutch for my studies but here's a little translation of what is happening in the video: When you approach the bar, a prompt appears, which I can add myself very easy through a prompt manager.
You can pick up a glass and give it to one of the avatars. While holding the glass, highlight effects appear—these are linked to avatar tags (for now these are the same avatars but they already have different tags).
The system records which avatar you gave the glass to and which prompt was active at the time. You can see that in the console log in the video! You can also see me using a painterly shader in this prototype—an oil paint shader I added to make the game look a bit nicer, and it really did!
But sadly, it was too demanding for deployment on the Oculus Quest 2/3, so I had to remove it...
Anyways once you put the glass down, everything resets: the old prompt is cleared, and a new one is generated the next time you come close to the bar. :D
