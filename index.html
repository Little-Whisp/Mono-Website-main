          My name is Silviani Martis and I am a third year CMGT student at Hogeschool Rotterdam! I chose this study
          because I love technology and I love creating my own stuff.
          Such as games, applications, websites, robots, you name it! I love to bring concepts I come up with to life
          and use my creativity to make that happen in a way that makes people happy :)

        <p>
          I work at a company called Sync VR. Sync VR Medical is a company that focuses on using Virtual reality to help
          out in the medical world. A group of goofballs that want to make things
          big and help people. I film with a 360 camera for projects and edit video's for virtual reality. I also make
          something we call, relax and distract exercises.
          Where I worked on this game like environment that helps the player relax and get distracted while undergoing a
          medical procedure.

          For my school I worked at project that's called VR lab, where I got the opportunity to introduce students to
          new technology such as cool VR headsets like the Varjo, 3D scanner applications,
          the Hololense and much more. VR lab wants students to be able to use the tech they offer quick and easy.
          That's why they give workshops for programs like Unity where you get to make your own little game, blender for
          3D modeling and I also gave my own workshop about
          360 editing in Premiere Pro! That's why it used to be my job to play around with new technology and look for
          creative methods on how VR lab can share that technology with students in an accessible way.

          Game school project (year 1) - Synthese
        </h1>

        <p>
          For this school project, we got to make an education game for kids. We called it Syntheses and mostly wanted
          to bring the theme of the game to life. We wanted the style to be
          Memorable and nice to look at. I mostly worked on the art of Syntheses and the code of the shoot function and
          the movement of our character Didi.

          Machine learning project (year 2) - DrugType Predictor
        </h1>

        <p>
          For this project, we had to make a web application that used machine learning to predict something. My
          application predicts the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for a patient!
          I took the opportunity to go all out with the style of the website because the visuals where very important
          during this project, because next to making a functioning website we as CMGT students
          find it very important to make our projects visually pleasing.
