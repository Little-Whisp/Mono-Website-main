        Who am I?
      </h1>

      <p>
      I am Silviani Martis and I am a second year CMGT student at Hogeschool Rotterdam! I chose this study because I love technology and I love creating my own stuff.
      Such as games, applications, websites, robots, you name it! I want to bring concepts I come up with to life and use my creativity to make that happen in a way that makes people happy :)

      <p>
        I work at a company called Sync VR. Sync VR Medical is a company that focuses on using Virtual reality to help out in the medical world. A group of goofballs that want to make things
        big and help people. I myself film with a 360 camera for projects and edit video's for virtual reality. I also make something we call, relax and distract exercises.
        Where I worked on this game like environment that helps the player relax and get distracted while undergoing a medical procedure.

          I also work for my school at something that's called VR lab, where I get to introduce students to new technology such as cool VR headsets like the Varjo, 3D scanner applications,
          the Hololense and much more. We also give workshops for programs like Unity where you get to make your own little game, blender for 3D modeling and I also give my own workshop about 
          360 editing in Premiere Pro! We at VR lab want students to be able to use the tech we offer quick and easy. That's why it's my job to play around with new technology and look for 
          creative methods on how we can share that technology with students in an accessible way.

    <h1>
      Game school project (year 1) - Synthese
    </h1>

    <p>
      For this school project, we got to make an education game for kids. We called it Syntheses and mostly wanted to bring the theme of the game to life. We wanted the style to be 
       Memorable and nice to look at. I mostly worked on the art of Syntheses and the code of the shoot function and the movement of our character Didi.

    <h1>
      Machine learning project (year 2) - DrugType Predictor 
    </h1>

    <p>
      For this project, we had to make a web application that used machine learning to predict something. My application predicts the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for a patient!
      I took the opportunity to go complete all out with the style of the website because this was very important during this project.
